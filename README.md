Diabetes Prediction Using SVM Algorithm
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical data using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📌 Features
✅ Uses SVM Classifier for prediction
✅ Implements StandardScaler for feature scaling
✅ Handles data preprocessing and model training
✅ Provides accurate predictions based on medical data

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

Pregnancies,Glucose Level,Blood Pressure,Skin Thickness,Insulin Level,BMI,Diabetes Pedigree Function,Age

Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍,Scikit-learn (SVM, StandardScaler),NumPy & Pandas
